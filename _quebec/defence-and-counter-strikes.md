## Defence and a Single Counter Strike

Initially, for the beginner, Quebec Serrada Kali can seem to be a very defensive style, as the student learns to block and then counter/attack with a single strike. A student has to remember that they are learning the basics of ‘Self Defence’ foremost, so when the instructor/opponent attacks, the student/defender will learn to defend with a block, and counter with a strike, initially only a single counter strike. Why only this single counter strike? Quebec Serrada Kali considers an opponent may be skilled and they will have a counter (block) to your attack, and they then will return a strike towards the initial attacker/opponent. If of course, either person does not defend/block and counter strike properly or their timing or aim is out, then they have left themself open to multiple strikes by an opponent.

## Defence and Multiple Counter Strikes

The single contacting strike, can lead to multiple strikes. If attacked, do not just cover and cover again but return fire. This return fire may contact and stun. Do not look at the opponent wishfully, as they may recover and then continue to attack, to harm you. When you see or create the opening, continue with several strikes. This may knock the opponent down or simply, render the opponent unable or unwilling to attack again. (Don’t turn your back). Never go overboard and continue to counter attack with multiple strikes, when someone is incapable of re-attacking. This may leave you open to legal action. Remember, ‘Self Defence’ when attacked, is the main aim of training.

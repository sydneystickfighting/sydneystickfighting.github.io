## What we're about

A group for practitioners of the Filipino art of [Balintawak Arnis][balintawak-eskrima] and aspects of other systems of Arnis and Escrima or Filipino Stick Fighting. Arnis (also known as Esgrima or Kali) is a very practical martial art that involves sticks, striking, grappling or improvised weapons. The same motions taught with weapons can also be used barehanded.

Find us on [Meetup][meetup].

It is becoming more popular (for example the [Jason Bourne][jason] movies or [other movies][other-movies]) and is usually practiced outdoors rather than in a gym. Beginners are always welcome, or you can just come along and watch the action!

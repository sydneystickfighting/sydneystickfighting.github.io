The sixth set of At–Random Balintawak Arnis strikes can be the #1,#3, #6, #7, and the #12 attacks from the instructor.

The student blocks/parries, clips whenever possible and returns a counter strike to the instructor’s head. The footwork of both student and instructor follows on from the earlier Balintawak Eskrima training of the instructor Balintawak Arnis Twelve (12) Basic Strikes and their Balintawak Escrima Blocks and Counters.

The Basic Blocks and Counters coincide with the Twelve Basic Strikes. The Basic Footwork is taught in conjunction with the Basic Blocks and Counters and gives the student the knowledge which is needed to manoeuvre and properly position their body for a more stronger faster reaction and defence.

The student blocks with the stick an attack by the instructor and the students empty hand follows a fraction behind the edge of the weapon. The empty hand attempts to help block or stem the force of the attack and then clips and clears the attackers weapon or arm by pushing and/or twisting it away or down.

The student does not fully grab the instructors stick with their empty hand, they only learn to clip the stick between their empty hand thumb and palm, allowing the instructor to pull away and move to another attack. A Free Wheeling or flowing motion can thus be obtained. If the student fully grabs the instructor’s stick, the instructor would counter using an advanced technique to defeat the students counter/grab and the training session could not continue.

The main aim at the beginning of the students training through the Free Wheeling motion, is to sharpen the students reflexes and to increase their reaction speed and awareness basic footwork.

The counters of the student are directed to the head and neck of the instructor for all the attacks except for the number twelve attack. The student is taught to counter a twelve with a twelve counter strike.

The instructor’s empty hand employs the ‘sikit’, breaking or stopping method of defence against the counters of the student. The instructors empty hand initially in breaking, acts as a type of focus mitt for the student. The instructor not only counters with their empty hand either by stopping/breaking but by also flowing through with the empty hand when their stick is clipped.

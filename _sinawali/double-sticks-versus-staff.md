The first Two Series of Open and Closed Position Sinawalis can now be trained (after the student has acquired Double Stick Versus Double Stick training) with a Staff Versus Double Sticks and then even Staff Versus Staff.
The Open and Closed Sinawali Positions â€“ Single Handed Striking are:

* High Low
* High High
* High Low High
* High High Low

The stick hand, (with the Double Sticks), say the right hand, in the Single Handed Striking, executes all the strikes first, before the other hand, the left hand, mirrors and executes the same striking attacks.

These Ammara and Sinawali Drills are simple exercises to teach a beginner combinations and are not to be confused with a full style of fighting.

The Staff is more complex and can require greater skill but with a proper coach, the exercises once learnt, are easy to execute.

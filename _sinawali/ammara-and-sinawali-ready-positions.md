Double stick drills are usually initiated from two basic poses. They are called the ‘Open’ and ‘Closed’ hand/arm positions.

At the start, the hands should be in a situation, where if the practitioner were to point the index finger of either hand, (from either the open or closed position), the index fingers would be pointing towards the opponent.

The exercises may start in these two positions but should be merely considered starting points and transitory positions while executing an exercise.

The Open Position is with the hands to the sides of the body, the ends of the sticks are at the face, with the sticks resting on the collarbones. The elbows are pulled backwards.

The Closed Positions are with one hand to the side of the body, the stick end at the face, with the stick resting on the collarbone, while the other hand is down at the front or stomach, the stick resting on the stomach, with it’s stick end pointing 90 degrees to the side of the body.
